# Collaborative_Online_Code_Judge
This is a platform for users collaboratively code, edit the coding and execute the coding.

1.Implemented a web-based collaborative code editor which supports multiple user editing simultaneously
(ACE, Socket.io, Redis);

2.Designed and developed a single-page web application for coding problems
(Angular6.0, Auth0, Node.js, MongoDB);

3.Built a user-code executor service which can build and execute userâ€™s code
(Docker, Flask);

4.Future plan: Refactor and Improve system throughput by decoupling services using RESTful API and loading balancing by Nginx
(REST API, Nginx).
